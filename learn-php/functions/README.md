# Mad Lib Functions
In this project, weâ€™ll use PHP to write a function to fill in a Mad Libs story! Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces, which get filled in by the user. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
Words to fill in those blanks.
