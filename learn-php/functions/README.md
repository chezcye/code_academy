# Mad Lib Functions
In this project, weâ€™ll use PHP to write a function to fill in a Mad Libs story! Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces, which get filled in by the user. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
Words to fill in those blanks.

# The Hitchhiker's Guide to PHP Math Functions
Each step of the project provides a math operation that can be completed using built-in PHP functions. Use the documentation to find them and apply them correctly to get the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
